      "the dame lesley strathie operational excellence award recognises excellence in the delivery of public services. this includes putting user needs at the heart of a project and significantly improving the quality value for money or productivity of services to the public. gov.uk notify is delivered by a multidisciplinary team of 12 people including designers user researchers and developers. they work closely with service teams across the country to constantly iterate and improve it. the judges said: gov.uk notify is a great example of a small diverse set of civil servants challenging established ways of doing things to rapidly deliver a product benefitting millions of people whilst saving taxpayers millions. gov.uk notify product manager pete herlihy said: it’s ace. obviously we’re incredibly proud of notify and the impact it’s having right across the public sector but this recognition for how our little team goes about delivering it really means so much to us. about gov.uk notify gov.uk notify sent its first messages in may 2016. it lets service teams across the public sector send emails text messages and letters to their users. it can be used by: caseworkers to send one off messages to people after a call or a visit back office staff to send bulk messages by uploading files systems automatically sending messages to people after specified events gov.uk notify is easy to use and easy for teams to integrate with their existing systems. it can be used without any procurement and emails can be sent through gov.uk notify at no cost. so far more than 200 million messages have been sent using gov.uk notify including more than 170 million emails. it is being used by 438 service teams across 132 organisations including 64 local government organisations 58 central government organisations and 10 from the nhs. and this number is growing every day. among those teams are the dvsa ’s mot reminder service team who also won a civil service award the digital award. find out more about gov.uk notify .\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider: \"duck\" (verb) vs. \"duck\" (noun)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to regular expressions, the matcher works with Doc and Token objects instead of only strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also more flexible: you can search for texts but also other lexical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even write rules that use the model's predictions.\n",

    "* Match lexical attributes  \n",

    "* Match any token attributes  \n",
    "[{'LEMMA': 'buy'}, {'POS': 'NOUN'}]  \n",
    "\n",
    "Match patterns are lists of dictionaries. Each dictionary describes one token. The keys are the names of token attributes, mapped to their expected values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we're looking for two tokens with the text \"iPhone\" and \"X\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also match on other token attributes. Here, we're looking for two tokens whose lowercase forms equal \"iphone\" and \"x\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can even write patterns using attributes predicted by the model. Here, we're matching a token with the lemma \"buy\", plus a noun. The lemma is the base form, so this pattern would match phrases like \"buying milk\" or \"bought flowers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Government context specific matching\n",
    "Fortunately registers exist which are [canonical sources of lists about Government](https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/category/government); there are registers for [organisations](https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/registers/government-organisation) and [services](https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/registers/government-service) (although if Departments have changed name we won't be able to spot these). We can use the API to get these and create a Dictionary of match patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is better than relying on regex, as often an organisation might preceed one if it's services in the text, but the text is referring to the service not the parent organisation. i.e. GOV.UK Notify"
